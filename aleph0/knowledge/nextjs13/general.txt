Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

Creating Routes
Next.js uses a file-system based router where folders are used to define routes.
Each folder represents a route segment that maps to a URL segment. To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other.
A Dynamic Segment can be created by wrapping a folder's name in square brackets: [folderName]. For example, [id] or [slug].
